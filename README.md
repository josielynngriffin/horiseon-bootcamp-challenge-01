# Horiseon Bootcamp Refactoring Challenge-01
## Description
In completing this assignment, my motivation was primarily to refactor the existing website to follow accessibility standards, and in doing so, better the website's search engine optimization as well. I also set out to improve the overall codebase, cleaning it up and ensuring everything functioned without altering the website's design.

To meet accessibility standards, I restructured the website's html to replace non-semantic divs with their more logical, semantic counterparts. I coordinated my changes in the HTML with the CSS every step of the way to avoid inconsistencies in my changes across the documents and keep the website's function and appearance in tact. In addition to semantic HTML structure, I added alt attributes to all images and icons and adjusted heading elements to follow sequential order.

Although making the website more accessible helped the website's overall search engine optimization, I also improved the website's SEO by adding a relevant title element and meta description tag in the head of the document.

Lastly, I cleaned up the code. I commented out the CSS to give markers before elements and sections of the page to make the code more easily understood by those who come after me. I reworked the CSS file to consolidate CSS selectors and properties among shared stylings to create less repetitive, DRY code. I fixed a broken link in the website's navigation as well.

One outside motivation behind this project was to become more familiar with maintaining a repository and managing it with github! I tried to organize the assignment by breaking the user story and acceptance criteria into GitHub issues and working in branches to complete each feature, using pull requests to merge into the main branch as I completed the code refactoring.
